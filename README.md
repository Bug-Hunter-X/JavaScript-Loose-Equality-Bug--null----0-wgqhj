# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug: null == 0

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript bug related to loose equality (==) comparisons.  In JavaScript, `null == 0` evaluates to `false`, but unexpected behavior can arise if not handled carefully.

## The Bug
The `bug.js` file contains a function that attempts to handle null values. However, it uses loose equality, which might lead to incorrect comparisons if other falsy values (like 0) are encountered.

## The Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  It uses strict equality (===) to avoid type coercion and ensures that only null values are correctly handled.
